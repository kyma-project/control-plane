## Installation

### Dependencies

Kyma Control Plane depends on [Kyma](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and [Compass](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/compass).

Kyma Control Plane, as a part of Kyma, uses [Octopus](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/octopus/blob/master/README.md) for testing. To run the Kyma Control Plane tests, run:

```bash
./installation/scripts/testing.sh
