# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains documentation on Kyma Control Plane (KCP) and its components.

Start with the overarching [KCP documentation](./kyma-control-plane) where you can find general information on KCP. 

Then, read about these components in more detail:
* [Kyma Environment Broker](./kyma-environment-broker)
* [Runtime Provisioner](./provisioner)

Under [Internal](./internal), you'll find internal documentation, such as investigations, proposals, and standards.

## Development


Follow these basic rules when you add a new document to the official documentation:

1. Get familiar with the [Content Strategy](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy) to learn about the official approach to content development.
2. Follow the [Contribution Guide](https://kyma-project.io/community/contributing/02-contributing/) for the general contribution rules and process.
3. Make use of the [templates](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/templates/templates-type/) to structure your documents properly.
4. Be compliant with the writing [guidelines](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content-guidelines/) to contribute high-quality and standardized content.
