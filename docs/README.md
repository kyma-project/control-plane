# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains documentation on Kyma Control Plane (KCP) and its components.

The documents are arranged in the fixed order that follows the [content strategy](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content/#content-strategy-content-strategy-documentation-types). Read about these components in more detail:
* [Kyma Environment Broker](./kyma-environment-broker)
* [Runtime Provisioner](./provisioner)

### Docs structure

The directory has the following structure:

```                                   
  ├── internal                   # Internal documentation, such as investigations, proposals, and standards
  ├── kyma-environment-broker    # Documentation for the Kyma Environment Broker component                                     
  └── provisioner                # Documentation for the Runtime Provisioner component     
```
