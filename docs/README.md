# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains documentation on Kyma Control Plane (KCP) and its components. The documents are arranged in the fixed order that follows the [content strategy](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content/#content-strategy-content-strategy-documentation-types).

Start with the overarching [KCP documentation](./kyma-control-plane) where you can find general information on KCP. Then, read about these components in more detail:
* [KCP CLI](./cli)
* [Kyma Environment Broker](./kyma-environment-broker)
* [Runtime Provisioner](./provisioner)

### Docs structure

The directory has the following structure:

```                                   
  ├── cli                        # Documentation for KCP CLI
  ├── internal                   # Internal documentation, such as investigations, proposals, and standards
  ├── kyma-control-plane         # Overarching documentation for Kyma Control Plane                                     
  ├── kyma-environment-broker    # Documentation for the Kyma Environment Broker component                                     
  └── provisioner                # Documentation for the Runtime Provisioner component     
```

## Development

Follow these basic rules when you add a new document to the official documentation:

1. Get familiar with the [Content Strategy](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy.md) to learn about the official approach to content development.
2. Follow the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/contributing/02-contributing.md) for the general contribution rules and process.
3. Make use of the [templates](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/main/guidelines/templates) to structure your documents properly.
4. Be compliant with the writing [guidelines](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/guidelines/content-guidelines) to contribute high-quality and standardized content.
