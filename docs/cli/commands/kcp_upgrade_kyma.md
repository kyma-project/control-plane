# kcp upgrade kyma

Upgrades or reconfigures Kyma on one or more Kyma Runtimes.

## Synopsis

Upgrades or reconfigures Kyma on targets of Runtimes.
The upgrade is performed by Kyma Control Plane (KCP) within a new orchestration asynchronously. The ID of the orchestration is returned by the command upon success.
The targets of Runtimes are specified via the `--target` and `--target-exclude` options. At least one `--target` must be specified.
The version is specified using the `--version` (or -v) option. If not specified, the version is configured by Kyma Environment Broker (KEB).
Additional Kyma configurations to use for the upgrade are taken from Kyma Control Plane during the processing of the orchestration.

```bash
kcp upgrade kyma --target {TARGET SPEC} ... [--target-exclude {TARGET SPEC} ...] [flags]
```

## Examples

```
  kcp upgrade kyma --target all --schedule maintenancewindow     Upgrade Kyma on all Runtimes in their next respective maintenance window hours.
  kcp upgrade kyma --target "account=CA.*"                       Upgrade Kyma on Runtimes of all global accounts starting with CA.
  kcp upgrade kyma --target all --target-exclude "account=CA.*"  Upgrade Kyma on Runtimes of all global accounts not starting with CA.
  kcp upgrade kyma --target "region=europe|eu|uk"                Upgrade Kyma on Runtimes whose region belongs to Europe.
  kcp upgrade kyma --target all --version "main-00e83e99"        Upgrade Kyma on Runtimes of all global accounts to the custom Kyma version (main-00e83e99).
```

## Options

```
      --dry-run                      Perform the orchestration without executing the actual upgrade operations for the Runtimes. The details can be obtained using the "kcp orchestrations" command.
      --parallel-workers int         Number of parallel workers to use in parallel orchestration strategy. By default the amount of workers will be auto-selected on control plane server side.
      --schedule string              Orchestration schedule to use. Possible values: "immediate", "maintenancewindow". By default the schedule will be auto-selected on control plane server side.
      --strategy string              Orchestration strategy to use. (default "parallel")
  -t, --target stringArray           List of Runtime target specifiers to include. You can specify this option multiple times.
                                     A target specifier is a comma-separated list of the following selectors:
                                       all                 : All Runtimes provisioned successfully and not deprovisioning
                                       account={REGEXP}    : Regex pattern to match against the Runtime's global account field, e.g. "CA50125541TID000000000741207136", "CA.*"
                                       subaccount={REGEXP} : Regex pattern to match against the Runtime's subaccount field, e.g. "0d20e315-d0b4-48a2-9512-49bc8eb03cd1"
                                       region={REGEXP}     : Regex pattern to match against the Runtime's provider region field, e.g. "europe|eu-"
                                       runtime-id={ID}     : Specific Runtime by Runtime ID
                                       plan={NAME}         : Name of the Runtime's service plan. The possible values are: azure, azure_lite, aws, trial, gcp, openstack
                                       shoot={NAME}        : Specific Runtime by Shoot cluster name
  -e, --target-exclude stringArray   List of Runtime target specifiers to exclude. You can specify this option multiple times.
                                     A target specifier is a comma-separated list of the selectors described under the --target option.
      --version string               Kyma version to use. Supports semantic (1.18.0), PR-<number> (PR-123), and <branch name>-<commit hash> (main-00e83e99) as values.
