# kcp completion

Generates completion script

## Synopsis

Generates completion script for Bash, Zsh, Fish, or Powershell.
### Bash

To load completions for Bash, run:
`$ source <(kcp completion bash)`

To load completions for each session, execute once:

- Linux:
`$ kcp completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/kcp`

- MacOS:
`$ kcp completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/kcp`

### Zsh

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:
`$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc`

To load completions for each session, execute once:
`$ kcp completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_kcp"`

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

### Fish

To load completions for Fish, run:
`$ kcp completion fish | source`

To load completions for each session, execute once:
`$ kcp completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/kcp.fish`

### Powershell

`PS> kcp completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression`

To load completions for every new session, run:
`PS> kcp completion powershell > kcp.ps1`
