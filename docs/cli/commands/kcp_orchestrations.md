# kcp orchestrations

Displays Kyma Control Plane (KCP) orchestrations.

## Synopsis

Displays KCP orchestrations and their primary attributes, such as identifiers, type, state, parameters, or Runtime operations.
The command has the following modes:
  - Without specifying an orchestration ID as an argument. In this mode, the command lists all orchestrations, or orchestrations matching the `--state` option, if provided.
  - When specifying an orchestration ID as an argument. In this mode, the command displays details about the specific orchestration.
      If the optional `--operation` flag is provided, it displays details of the specified Runtime operation within the orchestration.
  - When specifying an orchestration ID and `operations` or `ops` as arguments. In this mode, the command displays the Runtime operations for the given orchestration.
  - When specifying an orchestration ID and `cancel` as arguments. In this mode, the command cancels the orchestration and all pending Runtime operations.

```bash
kcp orchestrations [id] [ops|operations] [cancel] [flags]
```
