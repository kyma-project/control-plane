# Usage

Kyma Control Plane (KCP) CLI comes with a set of commands, each of which has its own specific set of flags.

For the commands and flags to work, they must follow this syntax:

```bash
kcp {COMMAND} {FLAGS}
```

- **{COMMAND}** specifies the operation you want to perform, such as displaying Runtimes.
- **{FLAGS}** specifies optional flags you can use to enrich your command.

See the example:

```bash
kcp runtimes --region westeurope
```

The CLI supports configuration file for common (global) options needed for all commands. The config file will be looked up in this order:

  - `--config {PATH}` option
  - `KCPCONFIG` environment variable which contains the path
  - `$HOME/.kcp/config.yaml` (default path)


See [the full list of commands, global options and flags](commands/kcp.md).
