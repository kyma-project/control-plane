# EU access

## Overview

EU Access requires, among others, that Data Residency is in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. 
For more information, see [EU Access Overview](https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/display/IntBusComp/EU+Access+Overview). 

BTP Kyma runtime service supports the BTP `cf-eu11` AWS and BTP `cf-ch20` Azure subaccount regions which are
called EU Access BTP subaccount regions. 
Kyma Control Plane manages `cf-eu11` Kyma runtimes in a separate AWS hyperscaler account pool and 
`cf-ch20` Kyma runtimes in a separate Azure hyperscaler account pool.

When the PlatformRegion is an EU access BTP subaccount region:
- Kyma Environment Broker (KEB) provides the `euAccess` parameter to Provisioner
- KEB services catalog handler exposes:
  - `eu-central-1` as the only possible value for the `region` parameter for `cf-eu11` 
  - `switzerlandnorth` as the only possible value for the `region` parameter for `cf-ch20`

## Access 
Due to limited availability, the provisioning request for the EU Access only regions can succeed only if GlobalAccountId 
is added to the list of allowed GlobalAccountIds (the whitelist).
The list is configured in the [management-plane-config repository](https://github.tools.sap/kyma/management-plane-config) 
in the `resources/control-plane/<landscape>/values.yaml` files.

Here you can find an example configuration of the whitelist with two GlobalAccountIds listed:
```yaml
kcp-prod:
  kyma-environment-broker:
    euAccessWhitelistedGlobalAccountIds: |-
      whitelist:
        - 2358e708-68f0-4af0-94b6-cf4e8407aff8
        - 4a8fa8f1-d76b-4682-89ba-84fe7591a07c
```

You must open a support ticket before attempting to provision Kyma clusters in the EU Access only regions to have your 
GlobalAccountId added to the whitelist.

If the GlobalAccountId for the provisioning request is not whitelisted, the Kyma Environment Broker responds 
with `http code 400` (Bad Request) and the message preconfigured in `management-plane-config`. 
The following message will be presented to the user in the BTP Cockpit.   
```yaml
kcp-prod:
  kyma-environment-broker:
    euAccessRejectionMessage: "Due to limited availability, you must open a support ticket before attempting to provision Kyma clusters in the EU Access only regions"
