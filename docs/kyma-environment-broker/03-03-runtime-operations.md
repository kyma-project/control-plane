# Runtime operations

Kyma Environment Broker allows you to configure operations that you can run on a Runtime. Each operation consists of several steps and each step is represented by a separate file. As every step can be re-launched multiple times, for each step, you should determine a behavior in case of a processing failure. It can either:

- Return an error, which interrupts the entire process, or
- Repeat the entire operation after the specified period.

> **NOTE:** It's important to set lower timeouts for the Kyma installation in the Runtime Provisioner.

## Operations

Operation defines stages and steps, which represents a part of work to be done.

The stage is a grouping unit for steps.

Step is a part of the stage

Operation can contain multiple stages, and stage can contain multiple steps.

Each step returns time value (duration) which tells if steps should be repeated or not, if duration is equal to 0 then it means that step was processed successfully and there is no need to repeat it, and the operation can go forward.
If duration is more than 0 it means that step need to be repeated and also all previous steps within stage are repeated from beginning.
It is each step responisbility to handle retries and ensure that it logic is executed once.
Retry pattern applies only to steps.
Once all steps in stage are executed with success, then stage is marked as finished and never repeat again, even if next one will fail.

### Provisioning

Each provisioning step is responsible for a separate part of preparing Runtime parameters. For example, in a step you can provide tokens, credentials, or URLs to integrate Kyma Runtime with external systems. All data collected in provisioning steps are used in the step called [`create_runtime`](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal/process/provisioning/create_runtime.go) which transforms the data into a request input. The request is sent to the Runtime Provisioner component which provisions a Runtime.
The provisioning process contains the following steps:

| Stage          | Step                                   | Domain                   | Description                                                                                                                                 | Owner           |

The timeout for processing the whole provisioning operation is set to `24h`. In Kyma 2.0 provisioning steps delegate resource creation to Reconciler. Since Reconciler does not constrain a number of retries in case of a failed reconciliation, KEB sets [provisioning timeout for Reconciler](../../resources/kcp/charts/kyma-environment-broker/values.yaml#L49) to `2h`.

### Deprovisioning

Each deprovisioning step is responsible for a separate part of cleaning Runtime dependencies. To properly deprovision all Runtime dependencies, you need the data used during the Runtime provisioning. You can fetch this data from the **ProvisioningOperation** struct in the [initialization](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal/process/deprovisioning/initialisation.go#L46) step.

Any deprovisioning step shouldn't block the entire deprovisioning operation. Use the `RetryOperationWithoutFail` function from the `DeprovisionOperationManager` struct to skip your step in case of retry timeout. Set at most 5min timeout for retries in your step.

The deprovisioning process contains the following steps:

| Step                         | Domain                           | Description                                                        | Owner                 |

| EDP_Deregistration           | Event Data Platform              | Removes all SKR entries from the Event Data Platform.              | Team Gopher           |
| IAS_Deregistration           | Identity Authentication Service  | Removes the ServiceProvider from IAS.                              | Team Gopher           |

| Check_Cluster_Deregistration | Reconciler                       | Checks if the cluster deregistration is complete                   | Team Gopher           |
| Remove_Runtime               | Deprovisioning                   | Triggers deprovisioning of a Runtime in the Runtime Provisioner.   | Team Gopher           | 

>**NOTE:** The timeout for processing this operation is set to `24h`.

### Upgrade Kyma

Each upgrade step is responsible for a separate part of upgrading Runtime dependencies. To properly upgrade the Runtime, you need the data used during the Runtime provisioning. You can fetch this data from the **ProvisioningOperation** struct in the [initialization](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal/process/kyma_upgrade/initialisation.go) step.

The upgrade process contains the following steps:

### Provide additional steps

You can configure Runtime operations by providing additional steps. To add a new step, follow these tutorials:

<div tabs name="runtime-provisioning-deprovisioning" group="runtime-provisioning-deprovisioning">
  <details>
  <summary label="provisioning">
  Provisioning
  </summary>

1. Create a new file in [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal/process/provisioning) directory.

2. Implement this interface in your provisioning step:

    ```go
    type Step interface {
        Name() string
        Run(operation internal.ProvisioningOperation, logger logrus.FieldLogger) (internal.ProvisioningOperation, time.Duration, error)
    }
    ```

    - `Name()` method returns the name of the step that is used in logs.
    - `Run()` method implements the functionality of the step. The method receives operations as an argument to which it can add appropriate overrides or save other used variables.


    ```go
    operation.InputCreator.SetOverrides(COMPONENT_NAME, []*gqlschema.ConfigEntryInput{
        {
            Key:   "path.to.key",
            Value: SOME_VALUE,
        },
        {
            Key:    "path.to.secret",
            Value:  SOME_VALUE,
            Secret: ptr.Bool(true),
        },
    })
    ```

    If your functionality contains long-term processes, you can store data in the storage.
    To do this, add this field to the provisioning operation in which you want to save data:

    ```go
    type ProvisioningOperation struct {
        Operation `json:"-"`

        // These fields are serialized to JSON and stored in the storage
        ProvisioningParameters string `json:"provisioning_parameters"`

        NewFieldFromCustomStep string `json:"new_field_from_custom_step"`    

        // These fields are not stored in the storage
        InputCreator ProvisionerInputCreator `json:"-"`
    }
    ```

    By saving data in the storage, you can check if you already have the necessary data and avoid time-consuming processes. You should always return the modified operation from the method.

    See the example of the step implementation:

    ```go
    package provisioning

    import (
        "encoding/json"
        "net/http"
        "time"

        "github.com/kyma-incubator/compass/components/provisioner/pkg/gqlschema"
        "github.com/kyma-incubator/compass/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal"
        "github.com/kyma-incubator/compass/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal/storage"

        "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
    )

    type HelloWorldStep struct {
        operationStorage storage.Operations
        client           *http.Client
    }

    type ExternalBodyResponse struct {
        data  string
        token string
    }

    func NewHelloWorldStep(operationStorage storage.Operations, client *http.Client) *HelloWorldStep {
        return &HelloWorldStep{
            operationStorage: operationStorage,
            client:           client,
        }
    }

    func (s *HelloWorldStep) Name() string {
        return "Hello_World"
    }

    // Your step can be repeated in case any other step fails, even if your step has already done its job
    func (s *HelloWorldStep) Run(operation internal.ProvisioningOperation, log *logrus.Entry) (internal.ProvisioningOperation, time.Duration, error) {
        log.Info("Start step")

        // Check whether your step should be run or if its job has been done in the previous iteration
        // All non-save operation data are empty (e.g. InputCreator overrides)

        // Add your logic here

        // Return the updated version of the Application
        return *updatedOperation, 0, nil
    }
    ```

3. Add the step to the [`/cmd/broker/main.go`](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/cmd/broker/main.go) file:

    ```go
    provisioningSteps := []struct {
   		stage   string
   		step     provisioning.Step
   	}{
   		{
   			stage: "create_runtime",
   			step:   provisioning.NewHelloWorldStep(db.Operations(), &http.Client{}),
   		},
    }
    ```

    Once all steps in the stage have finished succeeded, the stage won't be retried even if the application is restarted.

  Deprovisioning
  </summary>

  1. Create a new file in [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/internal/process/deprovisioning) directory.

2. Implement this interface in your deprovisioning step:

    ```go
    type Step interface {
        Name() string
        Run(operation internal.DeprovisioningOperation, logger logrus.FieldLogger) (internal.DeprovisioningOperation, time.Duration, error)
    }
    ```

    - `Name()` method returns the name of the step that is used in logs.
    - `Run()` method implements the functionality of the step. The method receives operations as an argument to which it can add appropriate overrides or save other used variables.


    If your functionality contains long-term processes, you can store data in the storage.
    To do this, add this field to the deprovisioning operation in which you want to save data:

    ```go
    type DeprovisioningOperation struct {
        Operation `json:"-"`

        // add additional data here
    }
    ```

    By saving data in the storage, you can check if you already have the necessary data and avoid time-consuming processes. You should always return the modified operation from the method.

    See the example of the step implementation:

    ```go
    package deprovisioning

    import (
        "encoding/json"
        "net/http"
        "time"

        "github.com/kyma-incubator/compass/components/provisioner/pkg/gqlschema"

        token string
    }

    func NewHelloWorldStep(operationStorage storage.Operations, client *http.Client) *HelloWorldStep {
        return &HelloWorldStep{
            operationStorage: operationStorage,
            client:           client,
        }
    }

    func (s *HelloWorldStep) Name() string {
        return "Hello_World"
    }

    // Your step can be repeated in case any other step fails, even if your step has already done its job
    func (s *HelloWorldStep) Run(operation internal.DeprovisioningOperation, log *logrus.Entry) (internal.DeprovisioningOperation, time.Duration, error) {
        log.Info("Start step")

        // Check whether your step should be run or if its job has been done in the previous iteration
        // All non-save operation data are empty (e.g. InputCreator overrides)

        // Add your logic here

        // Add a call to an external service (optional)
        response, err := s.client.Get("http://example.com")
        if err != nil {
            // Error during a call to an external service may be temporary so you should return time.Duration
            // All steps will be repeated in X seconds/minutes
            return operation, 1 * time.Second, nil
        }
        defer response.Body.Close()

        body := ExternalBodyResponse{}
        err = json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(&body)
        if err != nil {
            log.Errorf("error: %s", err)
            // Handle a process failure by returning an error or time.Duration
        }

        // If a call or any other action is time-consuming, you can save the result in the operation
        // If you need an extra field in the DeprovisioningOperation structure, add it first
        // in the step below; beforehand, you can check if a given value already exists in the operation
        operation.HelloWorlds = body.data
        updatedOperation, err := s.operationStorage.UpdateDeprovisioningOperation(operation)
        if err != nil {
            log.Errorf("error: %s", err)
            // Handle a process failure by returning an error or time.Duration
        }

        // If your step finishes with data which should be added to override used during the Runtime deprovisioning,
        // add an extra value to operation.InputCreator, then return the updated version of the Application
        updatedOperation.InputCreator.SetOverrides("component-name", []*gqlschema.ConfigEntryInput{
            {
                Key:   "some.key",
                Value: body.token,
            },
        })

        // Return the updated version of the Application
        return *updatedOperation, 0, nil
    }
    ```

3. Add the step to the [`/cmd/broker/main.go`](https://github.com/kyma-project/control-plane/blob/main/components/kyma-environment-broker/cmd/broker/main.go) file:

    ```go
    deprovisioningSteps := []struct {
   		weight   int
   		step     deprovisioning.Step
   	}{
   		{
   			weight: 1,
   			step:   deprovisioning.NewHelloWorldStep(db.Operations(), &http.Client{}),
   		},
    }
    ```

    The weight of the step should be greater than or equal to 1. If you want the step to be performed before a call to the Runtime Provisioner, its weight must be lower than the weight of the `remove_runtime` step.

2. Implement this interface in your upgrade step:

    ```go
    type Step interface {
