Orchestration is a mechanism that allows you to upgrade Kyma Runtimes. To create an orchestration, [follow this tutorial](#tutorials-orchestrate-kyma-upgrade). After sending the request, the orchestration is processed by `KymaUpgradeManager`. It lists Shoots (Kyma Runtimes) in the Gardener cluster and narrows them to the IDs that you have specified in the request body. Then, `KymaUpgradeManager` performs the [upgrade steps](#details-runtime-operations) logic on the selected Runtimes.

If Kyma Environment Broker is restarted, it reprocesses the orchestration with the `IN PROGRESS` state.

>**NOTE:** You need an OIDC ID token in the JWT format issued by a (configurable) OIDC provider which is trusted by Kyma Environment Broker. The `groups` claim must be present in the token, and furthermore the user must belong to the configurable admin group (`runtimeAdmin` by default) to create an orchestration. To fetch the orchestrations, the user must belong to the configurable operator group (`runtimeOperator` by default).

Orchestration API consist of the following handlers:

- `GET /orchestrations` - exposes data about all orchestrations.
- `GET /orchestrations/{orchestration_id}` - exposes data about a single orchestration status.
- `GET /orchestrations/{orchestration_id}/operations` - exposes data about operations scheduled by the orchestration with a given ID.
- `GET /orchestrations/{orchestration_id}/operations/{operation_id}` - exposes the detailed data about a single operation with a given ID.
- `POST /upgrade/kyma` - schedules the orchestration. It requires specifying a request body.

For more details, follow the tutorial on how to [check API using Swagger](#tutorials-check-api-using-swagger).

## Strategies

To change the behavior of the orchestration, you can specify a **strategy** in the request body.
For now, there is only one **parallel** strategy with two types of schedule:

- Immediate - schedules the upgrade operations instantly.
- MaintenanceWindow - schedules the upgrade operations with the maintenance time windows specified for a given Runtime.

You can also configure how many upgrade operations can be executed in parallel to accelerate the process. Specify the **parallel** object in the request body with **workers** field set to the number of concurrent executions for the upgrade operations.

The example strategy configuration looks as follows:

```json
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "parallel",
    "schedule": "maintenanceWindow",
    "parallel": {
      "workers": 5
    }
  }
}
```
